```{r}
library(dplyr)
PDB <- "PDB_Data_bioinformatics.csv"
PDBstats = read.csv(PDB)


#Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy
PDBstats
#removed commas
totalSUM<-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",PDBstats$Total)))
EMSUM<-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",PDBstats$EM)))
XraySUM<-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",PDBstats$X.ray)))
Q1<-((EMSUM+XraySUM)/totalSUM)*100
(EMSUM/totalSUM)*100
(XraySUM/totalSUM)*100
#answer is 
#EM:10.2348
#Xray:83.25592
#Both:93.49072
#could also create a function and then do colSums(apply(PDBstats, 2, covert_comma_numbers))
#convert comma numbers is your function, I didn't include this in my code but it is basically a gsub function
#could also do this in the tidyverse using the readr library and also read_csv, this will automatically make things numeric

#Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
totalnocommas<-as.numeric(gsub(",","",PDBstats$Total))
sum(totalnocommas[1:3])
#protiens is 221940

#Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
#4563 structures.

#how to load in an image

#![HSG with the asp highlighted](1HSG-2.png)
#![HSG with water highlighted](1HSG-3.png)

#Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
#becuase hydrogen is too small to include

#Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have
#its water 308

#Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document
