today before diving into structural position w/ alphafold we will finish off the PCA section from the previous lab

```{r}
library(bio3d)
id<-"1ake_A"
aa<-get.seq(id)
aa
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
b<-blast.pdb(aa)
attributes(b)
head(b$hit.tbl)
hits<-plot(b)
attributes(hits)
hits$pdb.id
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

I have now found and downloaded all ADK structures but viewing it looks terrible. they need to be aligned and superposed

I am going to install bioCmanager from Cran. Then I can use BiocManager::install() to install bioconductor package

```{r}
#Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
pdbs
```

to examine in more detail what any PC is capturing we can plot the loadings or make a trajectory of moving along PC1

```{r}
pc<-pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
plot(pc, pc.axes = c(1:2))
mktrj(pc, pc=1, file="pc1.pdb")

```
